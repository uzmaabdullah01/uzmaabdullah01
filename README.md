# Dr. Uzma Abdullah, PhD — Economist, Machine Learning Analyst, and Data Scientist

I am a PhD-trained International Economist and MIT-certified Applied Data Scientist with expertise at the intersection of econometrics, machine learning, and policy analytics.

My research and professional work focus on high-technology exports, trade competitiveness, economic forecasting, and data-driven decision-making. I specialize in advanced econometric modeling (OLS, IV, panel data, GLS, Bayesian methods) alongside predictive machine learning techniques including regression regularization, ensemble methods, cross-validation, and time-series forecasting.

As a Regional Economist with the UN World Food Programme, I conducted infrastructure impact assessments and cost-benefit analysis to support food security and regional economic development. I have also served as Assistant Professor teaching Econometrics, Statistical Inference, and Microeconomics, mentoring graduate research and guiding empirical thesis work.

Through the MIT Applied Data Science Program and ongoing MS in Applied Data Science at Boston University, I have expanded my expertise into AI-driven analytics, deep learning (CNNs, Transformers), big data (Spark, Hive), and cloud-based ML deployment.

I operate at the intersection of economics and AI — combining causal rigor with predictive power to support strategic policy, development initiatives, and financial decision-making.

Open to roles in economic policy, applied econometrics, AI-driven analytics, and strategic data science.
